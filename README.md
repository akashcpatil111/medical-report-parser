# medical-report-parser
This  is an IDP pipeline digitizing medical reports. It uses Tesseract OCR and Gemini 2.5 Flash to convert images into structured JSON, performing layout analysis and entity extraction. The system applies clinical reasoning to flag abnormal results and uses Pydantic for data integrity. A responsive dashboard allows for real-time visualization.
